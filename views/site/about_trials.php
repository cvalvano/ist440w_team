            <h3>What are Clinical Trials?</h3>
            <p>
                Clinical trials are experiments done in clinical research. Such prospective biomedical or behavioral research
                studies on human participants are designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral
                interventions, including new treatments (such as novel vaccines, drugs, dietary choices, dietary supplements,
                and medical devices) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison. Clinical trials
                generate data on safety and efficacy. They are conducted only after they have received health authority/ethics
                committee approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought. These authorities are responsible
                for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial - their approval does not mean that the therapy is 'safe'
                or effective, only that the trial may be&nbsp;conducted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll volunteers and/or patients
                into small pilot studies, and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies. Clinical
                trials can vary in size and cost, and they can involve a single research center or multiple centers, in one
                country or in multiple countries. Clinical study design aims to ensure the scientific validity and
                reproducibility of the&nbsp;results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trials can be quite costly, depending on a number of factors. The sponsor may be a governmental organization
                or a pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device company. Certain functions necessary to the trial,
                such as monitoring and lab work, may be managed by an outsourced partner, such as a contract research
                organization or a central laboratory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only 10% of all drugs started in human clinical trials become an approved drug.

                    <p>
                        Phase 0 trials are the first-in-human trials. Single subtherapeutic doses of the study drug or treatment
                        are given to a small number of subjects (10 to 15) to gather preliminary data on the agent's pharmacodynamics
                        (what the drug does to the body) and pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drugs). For a test drug,
                        the trial documents the absorption, distribution, metabolization, and removal (excretion) of the drug, and
                        the drug's interactions within the body, to confirm that these appear to be as&nbsp;expected.

                        to identify side effects. A drug's side effects could be subtle or long term, or may only happen with a
                        few people, so phase 1 trials are not expected to identify all side&nbsp;effects.

            <h3>Good Clinical Practice (GCP)</h3>
            <p>
                Good clinical practice (GCP) is an international quality standard that is provided by ICH, an international
                body that defines standards, which governments can transpose into regulations for clinical trials involving
                human subjects. A similar guideline for clinical trials of medical devices is the international standard
                ISO 14155, that is valid in the European Union as a harmonized standard. These standards for clinical
                trials are sometimes referred to as ICH-GCP or ISO-GCP to differentiate between the two and the lowest grade
                of recommendation in clinical&nbsp;guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                GCP follows the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) of GCP guidelines. GCP enforces tight guidelines
                on ethical aspects of a clinical study. High standards are required in terms of comprehensive documentation
                for the clinical protocol, record keeping, training, and facilities, including computers and software. Quality
                assurance and inspections ensure that these standards are achieved. GCP aims to ensure that the studies are
                scientifically authentic and that the clinical properties of the investigational product are properly documented.
                Ongoing research shows that whether conducting research involving a new drug, a behavioral intervention, or
                an interview or survey, GCP provides investigators and their study teams with the tools to protect human
                subjects and collect quality&nbsp;data.
            </p>
            <p>
                GCP guidelines include protection of human rights for the subjects and volunteers in a clinical trial. It
                also provides assurance of the safety and efficacy of the newly developed&nbsp;compounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                GCP guidelines include standards on how clinical trials should be conducted, define the roles and responsibilities
                of clinical trial sponsors, clinical research investigators, and monitors. In the pharmaceutical industry
                monitors are often called Clinical Research&nbsp;Associates.

            <h3>Informed Consent</h3>
            <p>
                Informed consent is a process for getting permission before conducting a healthcare intervention on a person.
                A health care provider may ask a patient to consent to receive therapy before providing it, or a clinical
                researcher may ask a research participant before enrolling that person into a clinical trial. Informed consent
                is collected according to guidelines from the fields of medical ethics and research&nbsp;ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
                An informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the
                facts, implications, and consequences of an action. To give informed consent, the individual concerned must
                have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts. Impairments to reasoning and
                judgment that may prevent informed consent include basic intellectual or emotional immaturity, high levels
                of stress such as PTSD or a severe intellectual disability, severe mental illness, intoxication, severe sleep
                deprivation, Alzheimer's disease, or being in&nbsp;a&nbsp;coma.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some acts can take place because of a lack of informed consent. In cases where an individual is considered
                unable to give informed consent, another person is generally authorized to give consent on his behalf, e.g.,
                parents or legal guardians of a child (though in this circumstance the child may be required to provide
                informed assent) and conservators for the mentally&nbsp;ill.
            </p>
            <p>
                In cases where an individual is provided insufficient information to form a reasoned decision, serious ethical
                issues arise. Such cases in a clinical trial in medical research are anticipated and prevented by an ethics
                committee or Institutional Review&nbsp;Board.
            </p>
            <p>
                Informed Consent Form Templates can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="//www.who.int/rpc/research_ethics/informed_consent/en/">World Health Organization Website</a>

            <p>
                The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA; Pub.L. 104–191, 110 Stat. 1936,
                enacted August 21, 1996) was enacted by the United States Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton
                in 1996. It has been known as the Kennedy–Kassebaum Act or Kassebaum-Kennedy Act after two of its leading
                sponsors. Title I of HIPAA protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families when
                they change or lose their jobs. Title II of HIPAA, known as the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions,
                requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national
                identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and&nbsp;employers.

            <h3>Institutional Review Boards (IRB)</h3>
            <p>
                An institutional review board (IRB), also known as an independent ethics committee (IEC), ethical review
                board (ERB), or research ethics board (REB), is a committee that has been formally designated to approve,
                monitor, and review biomedical and behavioral research involving humans. They often conduct some form of
                risk-benefit analysis in an attempt to determine whether or not research should&nbsp;be&nbsp;done
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of the review process is to assure, both in advance and by periodic review, that appropriate
                steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of humans participating as subjects in a research study.
                A key goal of IRBs is to protect human subjects from physical or psychological harm, which they attempt to
                do by reviewing research protocols and related materials. The protocol review assesses the ethics of the
                research and its methods, promotes fully informed and voluntary participation by prospective subjects
                capable of making such choices (or, if that is not possible, informed permission given by a suitable proxy),
                and seeks to maximize the safety of&nbsp;subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Department of Health and Human Services
                (specifically Office for Human Research Protections) regulations have empowered IRBs to approve, require
                modifications in planned research prior to approval, or disapprove research. IRBs are responsible for
                critical oversight functions for research conducted on human subjects that are "scientific," "ethical,"
                and&nbsp;"regulatory."
            </p>
            <p>
                IRBs are most commonly used for studies in the fields of health and the social sciences, including anthropology,
                sociology, and psychology. Such studies may be clinical trials of new drugs or devices, studies of personal
                or social behavior, opinions or attitudes, or studies of how health care is delivered and might be&nbsp;improved.
